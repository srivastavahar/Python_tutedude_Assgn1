# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial
# using a loop or recursion.
# 2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
# 3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
# Expected
# Output: For example,
# if the function is called with 5, it should return:

# def factorial(n):
#     if n<2:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return n * (factorial(n-1))
# res=factorial(3)
# print(res)


# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.Asks the user for a number as input.
# 2. Uses the math module to calculate the:
# Square root of the number
# Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
# Sine of the number (in radians)
# 3. Displays the calculated results.
#  Expected Output:
#  For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:

import math
n=int(input("Enter the number : "))

st = math.sqrt(n)
nl = math.log(n)
sv = math.sin(n)

print(f"Square root of {n} = {st}")
print(f"Natural log of {n} = {nl}")
print(f"Sine of {n} (in radians) = {sv}")
